                <h3>History of BCCI :-</h3>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>At the outset, there is nothing significant about the year 1721, as far as India's political history is concerned. Aurangzeb, the sixth of the great Mughals, had passed away in 1707, and the Empire he and his forefathers had built, had started to disintegrate. The Marathas were gaining in prominence, and in the process of knocking hard on the doors of Delhi. These were prominent happenings; what was peripheral was that 'merchants' from England and France had established 'settlements' in select areas of the subcontinent, and were going about their business of trade.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>The sea-route being the sole link between them and their respective homelands, most of these settlements were situated in the coastal areas of the Indian peninsula.

                        It was sometime in 1721 that a British ship dropped anchor off the coast of Kutch in western India. The recreational activities the sailors indulged in on the coast elicited curious reactions from onlookers. One of the sailors, who answered to the name of Downing, recalled his time on the Kutch coast in his memoirs thus: "We everyday diverted ourselves with playing cricket and other exercises"
                        
                        This is the earliest recorded reference to cricket in India.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>As the merchants metamorphosed into rulers, they continued to demonstrate their recreational pursuits on Indian soil. The British army took on the English settlers in what was the first recorded cricket match in India in 1751.

                        The establishment of the Calcutta Cricket Club (what we know today as CC & FC) in 1792, was another watershed for the sport in the land. In fact, it is the second-oldest cricket club in the world, after the MCC (1787).
                        
                        Ten years after its inception, the CCC organized a match between its team and the Old Etonians. The highlight of the game was Old Etonian Robert Vansittart's hundred. It was the first 'recorded' century on Indian soil.

            <h3>Indian Men's Team History :-</h3>

            <blockquote>
                <p>India played their first Test match, against England at Lord's, in 1932, but it took over 70 years for them to truly come into their own as a force in cricket: they developed into one of the game's powerhouses under Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and especially Virat Kohli, in the second decade of the 21st century.</p>

                <p>Sunil Gavaskar, perhaps India's first world-beating batter, who was the first to the 10,000-run milestone in Tests, came along in the early 1970s. Kapil Dev, an allrounder who ranked with the world's best, and India's finest since spinner-batter Vinoo Mankad in the 1940s, broke through later that decade.</p>

                <p>Fan following for the sport in the country surged in the years following their fairy-tale first ODI World Cup win, in 1983, and by the late 1990s, India was the world's biggest cricket market, and the money from the sale of TV rights to grab the attention of its hundreds of millions of fans had begun in large part to call the shots in the game.</p>

                <p>The rise of Sachin Tendulkar, a world-record-setting superstar batter like none in the game before him, helped underline the country's growing stature in cricket. Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Sourav Ganguly, and a little later Virender Sehwag, were the lynchpins of a golden age of Indian batting in the 2000s.</p>

                <p>As a Test side India have been close to unbeatable at home for over 35 years, having lost only three full home series since 1987. In the 1990s it was their spinners - India's greatest match-winner, Anil Kumble, and a support cast - who gave them home advantage. In the second half of the 2010s and after, India also produced excellent fast bowlers (Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and others) to become one of the most formidable teams in Test cricket, home and away.</p>

                <p>They went 11 Test series without a loss from 2008-09, won two Test series on the bounce in Australia starting 2018-19, and got to the final of the World Test Championship in both of the first two cycles of that tournament.
                </p>

                <p>In limited-overs cricket India have been somewhat less consistent. After a minor purple patch in the 1980s, they next had a good run when they secured ICC white-ball tournament wins in 2007, 2011 and 2013. There was another ten-year wait till they next got their hands on ICC silverware - the T20 World Cup in 2024.</p>

                <p>The most significant development in Indian cricket over the last half-century has probably been the birth and success of the Indian Premier League, the most lucrative and most competitive T20 league in the world, which kicked off in 2008.</p>
